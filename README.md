## Documentation

- [`GLOSSARY.md`](GLOSSARY.md) — terminology, taken from the owner's manual.
  Read this first; the pedal's vocabulary is precise and easy to get wrong.
- [`log/CAPTURE_ANALYSIS.md`](log/CAPTURE_ANALYSIS.md) — the USB protocol as
  derived from real captures, with confirmed-vs-inferred grading.
- [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md) — the original design spec, partly superseded by the above.
